Some animation utilities.

The ngv.Playhead class implements an object with an abstract playhead behavior as you might
find behind some VCR like controls. It can also be used for things like stop watches.

to use, start by making a new playhead object like so:

var ph = new ngv.Playhead();

A playhead object has 5 methods:

ph.start();
This makes the playhead start counting up, basically equivalent to the "play" function.

ph.stop(); 
This method pauses the playhead. The playhead can be resumed from where it left off with another
call to ph.start();

ph.reset(); 
this method moves the playhead back to to 0 milliseconds. If the playhead is playing, the playhead continues
moving forward. if it's stopped, it simply resets the playhead.

ph.set(milliseconds);
this method sets the playhead to a specific point in time. If the playhead is currently playing, then
the playhead continues moving forward, if it is stopped, the playhead remains stationary. 

ph.time();
this method returns the current elapsed time, in milliseconds, that the playhead has from the start.
The typical usage is to call this function intermittently using something like setInterval.
